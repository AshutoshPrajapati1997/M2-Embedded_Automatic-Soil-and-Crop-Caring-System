# Test Plan & Output

## Testing was done to ascertain the performance of the sub-circuits and then whole system degree of accuracy as well as the reliability. The testing of this automated irrigation control system was carried out in sequential manner starting from the individual component to the sub-circuits and finally the whole system as mentioned above. This was done to know whether the system is performing well or not, and if the design specifications conform with the systems operations. Result of Simulation Using Proteus Virtual Simulation Module.
